# waypaper-logo

I'm happy to help free software projects get their logos! Feel free to message me on linkedin or @me on a repo if you have a request :)

The files for the Waypaper logo are saved on this repo. You can use them as you see fit (for ex if you want to do a fork or just want to check what svg files look like)

Waypaper is pretty cool, is one of those programs that you only realize you neeeded after you start using it. I can finally <strike>shuffle my anime waifus wallpapers on hyprland</strike> change my wallpaper easily!
